      <h1>I tried to learn coding by making 180 websites!</h1>
      <p>
        From August 23st, 2020, I made one website a day, every single day as a
        learn to code project. Along the way, I published all my code publicly
        on GitHub and wrote a blog post to record the gains. Started with just a
        little html and css, I'm working on reactjs, nodejs and mongodb...to be
        continued
